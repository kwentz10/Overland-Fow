Modeling Overland Flow During a Storm Event 

To my reviewer,

You will want to download all the files in this repository because the function files are run in the OverlandFlow.m script. 
I was tinkering around with changing rain rate during the runtime-->see r variable under initialize block. I am interested in 
how to display text of variable on matlab figures, so I can show time and rain rate on each plot. Do you know of a way to
do this?
